# Python-IP-Criminal-Record-Checker
A python command line tool that checks the IP's online reputations.

This program relies on the AbuseIpDb, Criminal IP, ProxyCheck, Virustotal and Spur APIs.

If you expect to find a clean and optimized form of code, change repository :) ...a better version will come soon, I hope.

To use this tool insert your APIs keys in the code:

Type in the file's directory cmdline: "python pytool.py " followed by the ip you want to check.

In the screenshot i checked a TOR exit node, if you CTRL+leftclick on the Subnet Report you will be sent to the AbuseIpDb's list of reported ips in the /24 or smaller subnet (based to the checked ip).

If you meet some code errors concerning the region, don't panic, almost always they concern Hong Kong or Taiwan...It's my and those stoner's fault. 
For other errors it's because I'm the stoner :)
We welcome any comment o advice.
